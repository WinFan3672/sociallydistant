        // milliseconds, then continues. FRB is a little different - it needs
        // to do time based, but the time we're interested in specifically is game
        // time. We use TimeManager.DelaySeconds to make sure that everything respects
        // game time and time factor (slow-mo, speed-up, and pausing). Therefore, we need
        // to check tasks every time Update is called because there could be any amount of 
        // time passed between frames. Frames could speed up considerably if the user drags
        // the window or performs some other kind of logic that freezes the window temporarily 
        // and then MonoGame calls Update a bunch of times to play "catch-up". Therefore, the
        // TimeManager.DelaySeconds will not internally wait anything, it calls Task.Yield which
        // immediately puts the task back on the message to process. Before running any code we want
        // to empty the _messagesToProcess into thisFrameQueue, then run all tasks on this frame. Next
        // frame everything will repeat.
