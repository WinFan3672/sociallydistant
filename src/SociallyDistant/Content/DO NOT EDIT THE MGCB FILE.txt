This is the root of Socially Distant's content assets directory.

Inside this directory, you will find textures, shaders, game scripts, and
other assets needed by the open-source version of the game. It does not
include assets used by Career Mode.

You will also find a "Content.mgcb" file. If you're experienced with
MonoGame, and want to import new assets, you may be tempted to edit
this file with the MonoGame Content Editor.

Don't.

YOUR CHANGES WILL BE WIPED.

Socially Distant uses AutoPipeline, which generates the MGCB file on the fly
during game build. This allows Career assets to be slipstreamed into the
build via a build script you don't have access to. 

If you want to add new assets to the game, just place them into the Content
directory and build the game. If the assets are supported by the game, they'll
automatically be processed by MGCB without any user intervention.

IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE HOW A SPECIFIC ASSET GETS BUILT:

Edit the "ContentOverrides.targets" file instead. AutoPipeline will use this
to apply any import settings you set.
