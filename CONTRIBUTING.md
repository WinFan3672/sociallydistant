# Contributing to Socially Distant
If you're reading this, it's likely because you're interested in contributing to the game's development. That's awesome, and it means a lot <3. However, there are a few housekeeping things you should know about.

## Developer Certificate of Origin
When contributing code to the game, you must sign the Developer Certificate of Origin. This certifies that you wrote the code you're submitting, or otherwise have permission to submit it in the first place. When
creating pull requests, all commits must contain a `Signed-off-by: YOUR NAME <YOUR EMAIL>` line as an indication that you have read and understand the Developer Certificate of Origin. Your work will not be merged
unless this check passes.

The Developer Certificate of Origin is presented below. You may also obtain a verbatim copy of this document at https://developercertificate.org/.

## Pull request format
Pull requests must follow the below formatting rules

### Squashing
Please squash your commits! Dealing with one single large commit is much better than many tiny commits. This helps us track down bugs and regressions to the exact contribution they came from.

### Commit message format
When writing a commit message, use the following example as a template. Commits should summarize what they're accomplishing and why, as well as what's being changed. If relevant, they must
also indicate what issues they resolve.

```
Allow shell scripts to be run from the File Browser

This change allows the player to write, save, and run shell scripts inside the GUI
instead of just in the Terminal.

- Add file association for `.sh` files
- Add shell script icon for `.sh` files
- Allow opening new Terminal sessions with code
- Fix issue where Terminal doesn't close after running its root command

Closes #226
Signed-off-by: YOUR NAME <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>

## Branches
Please do not commit directly to `master`. The `master` branch represents the current stable release of the game.

Development of the next version of the game is done on a `work/VERSION` branch. Only team members may merge into these branches.

Only team members may create branches under the `work/` prefix.

The `devel` branch is identical to `master`, but includes outside contributions destined for the next version of the game. The
`work/VERSION` branches are rebased onto it.

For all other contributors,

1. Fork the project if you haven't already
2. When starting a new contribution, create a new branch to work inside
3. Name it after the feature you're working on, e.g. `ssh-hacking`, `accessibility-fixes`, `my-awesome-feature`
4. Commit changes to that branch on your fork.
5. Squash all of your commits into one, using the template above for the message.
6. Create a pull request on this repository, requesting to merge your branch into the `devel` branch.

## Code review and code style
All code contributions must look like it belongs in the game's codebase. If you're using Rider, it will enforce
the game's code style with warnings and refactor suggestions. Please do follow them.

All contributions must pass a code review before merging.
