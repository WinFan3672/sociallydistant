# Add users to devices for shell logins.
# First parameter is the device to add the user to
# Second is the user's name
# Third is the user type: either "admin" or "limited". Meanings are the same as on Microsoft Windows.
# Fourth is the authentication level and determines how hard the user is to crack. Can be either:
#  - password - a random password is generated for the user that can be password-cracked
#  - password_or_key - generates a much longer random password, but the hacker can also get in faster if they can find a private key
#  - keyonly - hacker must obtain the correct private key for the user, can't be cracked
#  - system - no login, user must already have access via another account.
#
# Note: You do not need to create root users, the game does this automatically and sets them up as system users.
