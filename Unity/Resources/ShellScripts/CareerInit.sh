#!WorldScript

# This script runs every time a save file is loaded or after it's been saved.
# The purpose of the script is to update the game's world based on the player's progression through
# Socially Distant's story.

# Mod hook for injecting code to run before core world flags

# World flags
#
# We will inevitably load a save file created before features or narrative elements were
# added to the game. World flags let us update the save file with new content. To do this,
# add a new 'requireflag' command here. The first parameter is the flag you want to check for,
# and the second argument is the command you want to run should that flag not be set in the save.
#
# World flags won't be set automatically when the command finishes. This allows you to also update
# the save file based on quest completion states, by setting a world flag on completion of a quest.
